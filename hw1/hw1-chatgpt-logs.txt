TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable

ChatGPT said:
The error you're encountering is caused by passing a tuple of words ("king", "man", "woman") to the embeddings object in this line:

python
Copy code
vecs = embeddings["king", "man", "woman"]
In Python, ("king", "man", "woman") is being interpreted as a single tuple, not as individual words. The __getitem__ method of your Embeddings class expects a list or iterable of words, not a tuple of arguments.

To fix this, you should pass a list or a tuple in the correct format, like this:

python
Copy code
vecs = embeddings[["king", "man", "woman"]]
This will retrieve the embeddings for each of the words "king", "man", and "woman" from the embeddings object.

Corrected Code:
python
Copy code
try:  # Load embeddings if they haven't been loaded yet
    embeddings
except NameError:
    embeddings = Embeddings.from_file("word_embeddings/glove_50d.txt")

# Find the neighbors of "king," "man," and "woman"
vecs = embeddings[["king", "man", "woman"]]
get_closest_words(embeddings, vecs, k=4)
This should resolve the TypeError you're seeing. Let me know if you encounter any more issues!

To modify the code so that it works correctly with the existing logic, we need to adjust the usage of the embeddings object when calling the cosine_sim function in the get_closest_words function. Specifically, we need to ensure that embeddings is passed as a list of vectors, not as a dictionary.

Here's how to modify your code:

Adjust get_closest_words:
Extract Embedding Vectors: Modify the code inside get_closest_words to get the word embeddings from the embeddings object by extracting all the vectors and using the corresponding keys for comparison.
Call cosine_sim with Embedding Vectors: Pass only the vectors from the embeddings to cosine_sim to calculate cosine similarities.
Modified Code:
python
Copy code

    all_vectors = np.array([embeddings[word] for word in embeddings.keys()])
    
    # Compute cosine similarity between the input vectors and all embeddings
    sims = cosine_sim(all_vectors, vectors)
    
    # Get the top k closest words for each input vector
    return [[list(embeddings.keys())[i] for i in np.argsort(sim)[-k:]] for sim in sims]
Key Changes:
Extract Embedding Vectors: all_vectors is a 2D array where each row corresponds to the embedding of a word in embeddings.
Cosine Similarity: We call cosine_sim(all_vectors, vectors) to compute the similarities between each input vector (vectors) and all the word vectors (all_vectors).
Return Top k Words: We find the k words with the highest cosine similarities for each input vector and return them.
This change ensures that you're working with the vectors from the embeddings dictionary (instead of passing the dictionary itself), which is necessary for cosine similarity calculation.

ChatGPT said:
The issue arises because the Embeddings class does not have a keys() method. Instead, it stores the words in the words attribute, and the indices dictionary maps each word to its index. To fix this, you need to modify the code in get_closest_words to use the self.words attribute when referencing the words in the embeddings.

Here’s how you can modify your get_closest_words function to work with this Embeddings class:

Modified get_closest_words:
python
Copy code

        k words that are closest to vectors[i] in the embedding space,
        not necessarily in order
    """
    # Extract all embeddings as a 2D array
    all_vectors = embeddings.vectors
    
    # Compute cosine similarity between the input vectors and all embeddings
    sims = cosine_sim(all_vectors, vectors)
    
    # Get the top k closest words for each input vector
    return [[embeddings.words[i] for i in np.argsort(sim)[-k:]] for sim in sims]
Key Changes:
embeddings.words: Instead of using embeddings.keys(), which doesn't exist, we use embeddings.words to get the list of all words in the embedding object.
embeddings.vectors: This is the matrix of all word embeddings, which is used in cosine_sim for computing similarities.
This should now work without issues because words is directly available as an attribute in the Embeddings class.

Example Usage:
python
Copy code
try:  # Load embeddings if they haven't been loaded yet
    embeddings
except NameError:
    embeddings = Embeddings.from_file("word_embeddings/glove_50d.txt")

# Find the neighbors of "king," "man," and "woman"
vecs = embeddings[["king", "man", "woman"]]
get_closest_words(embeddings, vecs, k=4)
This code should now correctly fetch the closest words to the given vectors. Let me know if you encounter further issues!

B
help me. debug
instructions:
Next, please implement the function get_closest_words. This function finds the k closest words to one or more given vector(s) in the embedding space. The given vectors do not have to be valid word embeddings (though they do need to have the same dimension as the word embeddings), and the k closest words do not have to be in order.
For example, this is how you would find the 4 nearest neighbors of king, man, and woman in the embedding space. (Note that each word is one of its own 4 nearest neighbors.)

Edit
Let me help debug your implementation of get_closest_words. I notice that your output shows incorrect results - you're getting punctuation marks instead of semantically similar words. Let's analyze the issue:

The main problem is in your get_closest_words implementation. The current code is:

python

Copy
def get_closest_words(embeddings: Embeddings, vectors: np.ndarray,
                      k: int = 1) -> List[List[str]]:
    all_vec = embeddings.vectors
    sims = cosine_sim(all_vec, vectors)
    return [[embeddings.words[i] for i in np.argsort(sim)[-k:]] for sim in sims]
There are two key issues:

You're computing similarities with cosine_sim(all_vec, vectors) which has the arguments in the wrong order. This means you're getting similarities between each word in the vocabulary and each input vector, but transposed from what we want.
You're iterating over sims which gives you similarities for each word in the vocabulary, rather than for each input vector.
Here's the corrected implementation:

python

Copy
def get_closest_words(embeddings: Embeddings, vectors: np.ndarray,
                      k: int = 1) -> List[List[str]]:
    """
    Finds the top k words whose embeddings are closest to a given vector
    in terms of cosine similarity.

    :param embeddings: A set of word embeddings
    :param vectors: A 2D array of shape (m, embedding_size)
    :param k: The number of closest words to find for each vector
    :return: A list of m lists of words, where the ith list contains the
        k words that are closest to vectors[i] in the embedding space,
        not necessarily in order
    """
    # Compute similarities between each input vector and all word vectors
    sims = cosine_sim(vectors, embeddings.vectors)
    
    # For each input vector, get the k words with highest similarity
    result = []
    for sim in sims:
        # Get indices of k highest similarity scores
        top_k_indices = np.argsort(sim)[-k:]
        # Convert indices to words
        closest_words = [embeddings.words[i] for i in top_k_indices]
        result.append(closest_words)
    
    return result
Key changes:

Fixed the order of arguments in cosine_sim(vectors, embeddings.vectors)
Process each row of similarities separately to get the k closest words for each input vector
Made the code more readable by breaking down the steps
Your cosine_sim implementation looks correct, so that wasn't the source of the problem.

Try running your code with this corrected implementation. You should now get results similar to the example output, where semantically similar words are returned. For example, with the input words "king", "man", and "woman", you should get lists of words that are semantically related to each input word rather than just punctuation marks.

Would you like me to explain any part of the correction in more detail?

how can i reduce your implementation to be 3 lines or less for everything that comes after not necessarily in order """

Edit
I can help condense the implementation while maintaining the same functionality. Here's the same logic compressed into 3 lines:

python

Copy
def get_closest_words(embeddings: Embeddings, vectors: np.ndarray,
                      k: int = 1) -> List[List[str]]:
    """
    Finds the top k words whose embeddings are closest to a given vector
    in terms of cosine similarity.

    :param embeddings: A set of word embeddings
    :param vectors: A 2D array of shape (m, embedding_size)
    :param k: The number of closest words to find for each vector
    :return: A list of m lists of words, where the ith list contains the
        k words that are closest to vectors[i] in the embedding space,
        not necessarily in order
    """
    sims = cosine_sim(vectors, embeddings.vectors)
    top_k_indices = [np.argsort(sim)[-k:] for sim in sims]
    return [[embeddings.words[i] for i in indices] for indices in top_k_indices]
This achieves exactly the same result but uses:

List comprehension to get the top k indices for each similarity row
Nested list comprehension to convert indices to words
No intermediate variables beyond what's absolutely necessary
The logic is identical to the longer version, just more concisely expressed.

now, help me complete run_analogy_test in a max of 9 lines

Edit

2 / 2

I'll help you implement run_analogy_test efficiently in 9 lines or less. This function needs to implement the 3CosAdd method for analogy testing, where for each analogy a:b::c:d, we try to find d by calculating a vector that should be close to b - a + c.

python

Copy
def run_analogy_test(embeddings: Embeddings, test_data: AnalogiesDataset,
                     k: int = 1) -> Dict[str, float]:
    results = {}
    for relation_type, analogies in test_data.items():
        correct = 0
        for a, b, c, d in analogies:
            if not all(word in embeddings for word in [a, b, c, d]): continue
            target_vec = embeddings[b] - embeddings[a] + embeddings[c]
            closest_words = get_closest_words(embeddings, target_vec.reshape(1, -1), k)[0]
            correct += d in closest_words
        results[relation_type] = correct / len(analogies) if analogies else 0
    return results
Here's what each line does:

Creates empty results dictionary
Iterates through each relation type and its analogies
Initializes correct count for current relation type
Iterates through each analogy tuple (a:b::c:d)
Skips analogy if any word isn't in embeddings
Computes the target vector using 3CosAdd formula (b - a + c)
Gets k closest words to target vector (reshaping to 2D for get_closest_words)
Increments correct count if target word d is in closest words
Stores accuracy for current relation type and returns results
This implementation:

Handles missing words by skipping analogies with out-of-vocabulary words
Uses the 3CosAdd method to predict the fourth word
Considers a prediction correct if the target word is among the k closest words
Returns a dictionary mapping relation types to their accuracies

Edit
I see the error - we're getting a KeyError when trying to access word embeddings, specifically for the character 'h'. This suggests that some words in the test data aren't properly processed or are missing from our embeddings. Let's modify the run_analogy_test function to handle word access more safely:

python

Copy
def run_analogy_test(embeddings: Embeddings, test_data: AnalogiesDataset,
                     k: int = 1) -> Dict[str, float]:
    results = {}
    for relation_type, analogies in test_data.items():
        total = 0
        correct = 0
        for a, b, c, d in analogies:
            if not all(w.lower() in embeddings for w in [a, b, c, d]): continue
            target_vec = embeddings[b.lower()] - embeddings[a.lower()] + embeddings[c.lower()]
            closest_words = get_closest_words(embeddings, target_vec.reshape(1, -1), k)[0]
            total += 1
            correct += d.lower() in closest_words
        results[relation_type] = correct / total if total > 0 else 0
    return results
Key changes made:

Added .lower() to all word lookups since embeddings are typically lowercase
Added a separate total counter to handle cases where we skip analogies
Changed the denominator to use total instead of len(analogies)
Added a check for total > 0 to avoid division by zero
The error occurred because some words in the test data might be:

In different case (uppercase vs lowercase)
Containing special characters or whitespace
Not present in the embeddings vocabulary
Try running it again with these changes. If you're still getting errors, could you show me a sample of the test data you're using? That would help identify if there are any other formatting issues we need to handle.

### Problem 1c: Extra Credit (Written, 5 Points)
Look at the following two lines of code. The first line of code prints the word embeddings $\overrightarrow{\text{the}}$ and $\overrightarrow{\text{of}}$. The second line of code looks similar to the first line of code, but it does not work as intended. Why is this? 
Note: Depending on how you've implemented the two blank methods in Embeddings, it's possible that your code may not behave as shown below. If that's the case, what do you think is the difference between your code and our code that would result in this discrepancy? 
(Regardless of what happens with the code below, you will receive full credit for Problem 1b as long as all the functional requirements shown above are implemented correctly.)

Edit
Let me help explain why the second line of code doesn't work. This is a great question about Python's handling of string inputs versus iterables in custom classes.

The key difference lies in how Python handles single strings versus collections of strings when passed as arguments:

In embeddings["the", "of"]:
Python treats this as a tuple of two strings
This is an iterable, so it works with the __getitem__ implementation which expects an Iterable[str]
In embeddings["the"]:
Python treats this as a single string, not an iterable of strings
The __getitem__ method expects an Iterable[str], but is receiving just str
A string is technically iterable (over its characters), but that's not what we want here
To fix this, you would need to modify the __getitem__ implementation to handle both cases. Here are two possible approaches:

Force single strings into a list/tuple:
python

Copy
def __getitem__(self, words: Iterable[str]) -> np.ndarray:
    if isinstance(words, str):
        words = [words]
    return np.array([self.vectors[self.indices[word]] for word in words])
Use method overloading to handle both cases:
python

Copy
def __getitem__(self, words):
    if isinstance(words, str):
        return self.vectors[self.indices[words]]
    return np.array([self.vectors[self.indices[word]] for word in words])
This is a common gotcha when implementing custom container classes in Python - you need to decide how to handle both single items and collections of items in methods like __getitem__.

ChatGPT: It looks like you're encountering a KeyError on 'c', meaning that the word c is missing from embeddings. The issue likely arises from this line in your loop:pythonCopyEditif not all(word in embeddings for word in [a, b, c, d]): continue
This checks whether all four words (a, b, c, and d) are in embeddings, and if any are missing, it skips the current analogy. However, there could be a mistake in how embeddings is structured or how words are stored.Debugging StepsPrint the missing wordsModify your check to explicitly print which words are missing:pythonCopyEditfor a, b, c, d in analogies:
    missing_words = [word for word in [a, b, c, d] if word not in embeddings]
    if missing_words:
        print(f"Missing words: {missing_words}")
        continue
This will help you confirm whether c is actually missing.Check Embedding KeysSometimes, words may have unexpected casing or whitespace issues. Try printing a few keys from embeddings:pythonCopyEditprint("Sample embedding keys:", list(embeddings.keys())[:10])
If your embeddings contain words like "king " instead of "king", you'll need to strip whitespace.Normalize Word CasesIf your dataset contains mixed-case words, ensure consistency:pythonCopyEdita, b, c, d = a.lower(), b.lower(), c.lower(), d.lower()
If your embeddings use lowercase words, this prevents mismatches.Check Data FormattingEnsure that test_data follows the expected format. Try printing an example:pythonCopyEditprint("Example analogy:", next(iter(test_data.values()))[:5])
If words aren't in the expected format, you may need preprocessing.Final FixOnce you've identified the cause, consider modifying your check:pythonCopyEditif any(word not in embeddings for word in [a, b, c, d]):

If your dataset has formatting issues (e.g., different casing, extra spaces), you might need preprocessing.Ensure Consistent Word Formatting
If words are stored in lowercase, apply .lower() before lookup:pythonCopyEditword = word.lower()
Handle Missing Words Gracefully
Modify the list comprehension to filter out missing words:pythonCopyEditreturn np.array([
    self.vectors[self.indices[word]] for word in words if word in self.indices

ChatGPT: The double brackets ([[b]] instead of [b]) are used for indexing into a NumPy array while maintaining a 2D shape. Let's break it down:1. Single Brackets: embeddings[b]If embeddings is a dictionary or a NumPy array, then:embeddings[b] (single brackets) returns a 1D array (a vector of shape (d,), where d is the embedding dimension).This can cause shape mismatches when performing operations like broadcasting.2. Double Brackets: embeddings[[b]]embeddings[[b]] returns a 2D array of shape (1, d), preserving the batch dimension.This is useful for consistent matrix operations.Why Did This Fix Your Issue?Your function calls:pythonCopyEdittarget_vec = embeddings[[b]] - embeddings[[a]] + embeddings[[c]]
likely fixed the error because get_closest_words() (or another function later in your pipeline) expected a 2D array, not a 1D vector.When to Use Double Brackets?Use embeddings[[b]] when:You need a 2D array (e.g., when passing to a function that expects batch input).You're using NumPy and want to perform row-based indexing.Use embeddings[b] when:You need a 1D vector.You're working with a dictionary where embeddings[b] retrieves a word vector directly.Let me know if you need more clarification!

Human: filter out dictionary using key values in a  list
ChatGPT: You can filter a dictionary based on a list of keys using a dictionary comprehension. Here’s how:Example: Keeping Only Specific KeysIf you want to keep only the keys in a given list:pythonCopyEditdata = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3, 'd': 4}
keys_to_keep = ['a', 'c']

filtered_dict = {key: data[key] for key in keys_to_keep if key in data}
print(filtered_dict)  
# Output: {'a': 1, 'c': 3}
Example: Removing Specific KeysIf you want to remove keys in a given list:pythonCopyEditkeys_to_remove = ['b', 'd']

filtered_dict = {key: value for key, value in data.items() if key not in keys_to_remove}
print(filtered_dict)  
# Output: {'a': 1, 'c': 3}

AttributeError: 'Embeddings' object has no attribute 'items'
ChatGPT: The error AttributeError: 'Embeddings' object has no attribute 'items' suggests that embeddings is not a standard Python dictionary. Instead, it's likely a custom object (e.g., a class wrapping word embeddings) that does not have the .items() method.How to Fix ItSince embeddings does not support .items(), you should check how it stores word embeddings. Here are some possible fixes:1. Check If embeddings Supports Dictionary-Like AccessTry:pythonCopyEditprint(type(embeddings))  # Check what kind of object it is
print(dir(embeddings))   # See available attributes/methods
If embeddings supports key-based indexing (like embeddings['word']), but not .items(), you can try:pythonCopyEditsyntactic_types_dict = {key: embeddings[key] for key in embeddings.keys() if key not in semantic_types}
If embeddings.keys() doesn't exist, try explicitly getting all keys:pythonCopyEditall_keys = list(embeddings)  # This works if it's iterable
syntactic_types_dict = {key: embeddings[key] for key in all_keys if key not in semantic_types}
2. If embeddings Uses a Lookup FunctionIf embeddings is a class that requires a lookup function (e.g., embeddings.get_vector(word)), modify your approach:pythonCopyEditsyntactic_types_dict = {key: embeddings.get_vector(key) for key in embeddings if key not in semantic_types}
3. If embeddings Is a NumPy ArrayIf embeddings is an array (e.g., np.ndarray), it doesn’t have .items(). You might need to use an index mapping instead:pythonCopyEditsyntactic_types_dict = {key: embeddings.vectors[embeddings.indices[key]] for key in embeddings.indices if key not in semantic_types}
(assuming embeddings.vectors stores embeddings and embeddings.indices maps words to indices)ConclusionSince embeddings is not a dictionary, check its attributes (dir(embeddings)) and find how it stores key-value pairs. Then adjust your code to use the appropriate access method instead of .items(). Let me know what type(embeddings) returns, and I can give a more specific fix! 🚀

ChatGPT: The issue in your output is that the dataset-level sizes (like "{'capital-common-countries': [('athens', 'greece', 'baghdad', 'iraq'), ...) are stored incorrectly. This happens because f'{dataset}_size' is using dataset, which is a dictionary, directly in an f-string, leading to an incorrect string representation of the dataset.Fix: Use Meaningful Names for Dataset-Level SizesModify your code as follows:pythonCopyEditsizes = {}
dataset_names = ["semantic", "syntactic", "total"]

for dataset_name, dataset in zip(dataset_names, [semantic_test_data, syntactic_test_data, test_data]):
    for key in dataset.keys():
        sizes[f'{key}_size'] = len(dataset[key])
    sizes[f'{dataset_name}_size'] = sum(len(dataset[key]) for key in dataset.keys())

print(sizes)
What This Fix Does:Uses dataset_name instead of dataset in f'{dataset}_size' to ensure proper string formatting.Prevents incorrect dataset string representations from appearing in the dictionary.Improves readability by explicitly defining dataset-level sizes as semantic_size, syntactic_size, and total_size.Example Expected Output:pythonCopyEdit{

This ensures that dataset-level sizes have correct names and the overall structure is clear. 🚀
ChatGPT: The issue in your output is that the dataset-level sizes (like "{'capital-common-countries': [('athens', 'greece', 'baghdad', 'iraq'), ...) are stored incorrectly. This happens because f'{dataset}_size' is using dataset, which is a dictionary, directly in an f-string, leading to an incorrect string representation of the dataset.Fix: Use Meaningful Names for Dataset-Level SizesModify your code as follows:pythonCopyEditsizes = {}
dataset_names = ["semantic", "syntactic", "total"]

for dataset_name, dataset in zip(dataset_names, [semantic_test_data, syntactic_test_data, test_data]):
    for key in dataset.keys():
        sizes[f'{key}_size'] = len(dataset[key])
    sizes[f'{dataset_name}_size'] = sum(len(dataset[key]) for key in dataset.keys())

print(sizes)
What This Fix Does:Uses dataset_name instead of dataset in f'{dataset}_size' to ensure proper string formatting.Prevents incorrect dataset string representations from appearing in the dictionary.Improves readability by explicitly defining dataset-level sizes as semantic_size, syntactic_size, and total_size.Example Expected Output:pythonCopyEdit{
 'capital-common-countries_size': 506,
 'capital-world_size': 4524,

 'gram1-adjective-to-adverb_size': 992,
 'syntactic_size': 10175,  # Sum of syntactic dataset sizes

}
This ensures that dataset-level sizes have correct names and the overall structure is clear. 🚀

ChatGPT: There's a small mistake in your print statement—you're referencing analogy, which isn't defined. You should explicitly reference the variables a, b, c to display the analogy correctly.Fixed Code:pythonCopyEdit# Define analogy questions of interest
