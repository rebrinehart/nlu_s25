    "## Problem 1: Understand TruthfulQA (30 Points in Total)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this first part of the assignment, you will examine the [TruthfulQA paper (Lin et al., 2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.07958) and [GitHub repository](https://github.com/sylinrl/TruthfulQA) in order to understand how the TruthfulQA experiments were conducted.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem 1a: Understand the Experimental Setup (Written, 10 Points)\n",
    "\n",
    "Subsection 3.1 of the paper describes how Lin et al. interacted with the LLMs tested in the paper via few-shot prompting. The exact prompts used in the paper are given in Appendix E. \n",
    "\n",
    "During Week 5, we learned that most NLP papers contain two experimentsâ€”a \"main\" experiment that answers a yes/no question, and an \"additional\" experiment that explains the results of the main experiment through further analysis. The main experiment is usually a quantitative evaluation of one or more models on a benchmark. The additional experiment might be a qualitative evaluation based on visualization of selected model components or outputs, or it might be a quantitative evaluation designed to extract fine-grained insights about what the model is doing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, look at the results shown in Figure 2 and Figure 4.\n",
    "* Which figure shows the results for the main experiment, and which shows the results for the additional experiment(s)?\n",
    "* Which set(s) of prompts from Appendix E were used for the main experiment, and which were used for the additional experiment(s)?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** Figure 4 shows the results for the main experiment, and answers the yes/no question of \"Do models exhibit a similar proportion of truthfulness/informativeness as humans?\". Figure 2 shows the results for the additional experiment, and answers the question of \"If we adjust for model size, how does that affect average truthfulness?\".\n",
    "\n",
    "To conduct the main experiment, all prompt types were used (QA, harmful, helpful, chat, and long-form). This comes from Section 4.1, which states that \"across all model sizes and *prompts*, the best model... produced 58% true answers and 21% true and informative answers\".\n",
    "A number of additional experiments used different prompt sets. For example, chat and long-form were used to understand how GPT-3's answers vary across prompts. All prompt types were used to answer how GPT-3-175B performs under different prompts. QA, chat, and long-form were used to understand truthfulness of GPT-3 with different temperatures.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem 1b: Understand the Evaluation Paradigms (Written, 10 Points)\n",
    "\n",
    "Subsection 3.2 of the paper describes the procedures by which Lin et al. evaluate LLMs on TruthfulQA. According to the paper:\n",
    "* What are the two methods by which an answer to a question is extracted from an LLM?\n",
    "* How is the \"truthfulness\" of a model calculated under each of those methods?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** \n",
    "The first method involves natural language generation. As stated in the paper, the \"model generates a full-sentence answer given a prompt and question\". The second method involves a multiple-choice variation of the same question used in the generation task, where the choices are \"sets of true and false reference answers\".\n",
    "To determine the \"truthfulness\" score of a model on a specific question, they first compute the \"likelihood of each reference answer independently, conditional on the default prompt and question\". The truthfulness score is then the total normalized likelihood of the true answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem 1c: Understand the Multiple Choice Paradigms (Written, 10 Points)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, we will be evaluating LLMs using the multiple choice paradigm. According to the GitHub repository, there are actually two different versions of the multiple choice paradigm: MC1 and MC2. What is the difference between MC1 and MC2? What is the difference between MC1 and text classification tasks such as sentiment analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "The version of the multiple choice paradigm that you will be implementing is MC1.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** MC1 is single-true, in that only a single answer choice can be correct. MC2 is multi-true, in that there can be multiple true answer choices. In both MC1 and text classification tasks, the model must assign a label to an input text. However, they differ in that in MC1, the model is given a set of possible answer choices and must evaluate all choices according to the question given, selecting the best one. This task may require greater reasoning. Text classification assigns with pre-defined labels, but the task structure is innately different, with no multiple-choice answer options. In text classification, the models often complete the task based on learned patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem 1d: Understand Prior Results (No Submission, 0 Points)\n",
    "\n",
    "Take a look at the results reported for MC1 on the GitHub repository. Notice that all the results are below chance (.25).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem 2: Implement Experiment Pipeline (40 Points in Total)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you will implement the TruthfulQA experiment by filling in the missing code from `truthfulqa.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem 2a: Examine Dataset (No Submission, 0 Points)\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use [a simplified version](https://huggingface.co/datasets/EleutherAI/truthful_qa_mc) of the TruthfulQA benchmark for this experiment, which has been converted into MC1 format and uploaded to the Hugging Face Hub. Please examine the format of the dataset and what kinds of questions and answers it contains."

    "In MC1, each question has four answer choices. Let $q$ denote a question, and let $a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4$ denote its four answer choices. According to the TruthfulQA paper and GitHub repository, the model's answer to question $q$ is given by: \n",

(In the next problem, you will write code to compute the loss for each text and choose the one with the lowest loss.) When `_get_input_texts` is called, the output should contain the input texts for each of the four answer choices, in order."

    "**Answer:** Among the four options tried, using both demos and a system prompt best alleviates susceptibility to imitative falsehoods, with an accuracy of 0.2968. When comparing demos only versus system prompt only, both impact model behavior similarly in regards to zero-shot, with both yielding an accuracy of 0.2632. One potential reason for this may be that 1.3b is a relatively small model, and thus is not as good at few-shot learning or prompt engineering as larger models.
